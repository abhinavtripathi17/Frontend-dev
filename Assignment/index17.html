                Hello! I am Abhinav Tripathi, a curious and enthusiastic student exploring web 
                development and programming. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving coding 
                challenges, and building small projects to improve my skills.

            <p>
                Today, I started my personal webpage project. It has been an exciting journey 
                learning HTML and understanding how web pages are structured. I look forward 
                to adding more content and styling it creatively.
